## About SEEKCommons

The Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons (SEEKCommons) project is dedicated to building pathways for horizontal collaborations across Science and Technology Studies (STS), Open Science (OS), and socio-environmental researchers and community organizers.

The SEEKCommons Fellowship is an initiative to bring graduate students and early-career researchers with new perspectives and voices to socio-environmental research with open technologies. Our program is designed to:

- Encourage new integrative practices involving environmental and climate action research with OS practices; and
- Provide a space for fellows and network members to connect on research issues, challenges, and solutions.

We are seeking 9 fellows for the inaugural 2024 SEEKCommons Fellowship. More details below:

- [Application Form](https://airtable.com/appIn7IkDUND83vC3/shrDl9Ot0H1gxAvbm) Open: September 5-October 15, 2023
- Successful Fellows notified: November 29, 2023
- Fellowship begins: January 22, 2024
- Fellowship ends: October 22, 2024

## Priority Topics for Fellowships

*Priority will be given to potential fellows with localized project focus. The datasets fellows work with should have significance to their community/partner communities*.
- Open technologies for data management, formats, standards, protection, and sharing strategies;
- Creating/adapting tools or workflows to support the reuse of strategic datasets;
- Open Hardware instrumentation for socio-environmental projects;
- Open data and metadata curation for sharing, protecting, and preserving socio-environmental environmental project outputs;
- Developing FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs) for  socio-environmental research for public benefit (with orientation of CARE principles);
- Beyond and alongside CARE, strategies / frameworks for addressing process as part of data use (which FAIR does not do);
- STS research on responses to OS institutional mandates, data protection and sharing practices, and commercialization of the sciences.

To encourage engagement with critical and emerging topics in socio-environmental research:

- One fellowship will be reserved for an indigenous STS fellow working on OS or Socio-Environmental issues;
- One fellowship will be reserved for a STS fellow working on AI and open environmental data.

### Eligibility Requirements
In order to be eligible for this fellowship program, you must:

- Be currently enrolled in a graduate program, or hold a postdoctoral appointment, or be a professional practitioner working in a community-based organization;
- Demonstrate clear alignment with the goals and objectives of the SEEKCommons project [SEEKCommons.org](https://seekcommons.org). This will be assessed via your application materials.

Of the nine fellowships offered in each cohort, at least one will be reserved for:
- An indigenous STS fellow working on the priority topics listed above under “potential research topics”
- An STS research fellow working on artificial intelligence (AI) and open socio-environmental data

**Please review our SEEKCommons [Fellowship FAQ](fellowship-faq.html) for additional eligibility information**.

### Fellows’ Responsibilities
To successfully engage in the fellowship opportunity, fellows will be expected to:

- Be actively involved in fellow cohort activities including:

- Preparation of a final research product (i.e. peer-reviewed publication, software package, hardware project, white paper, website, data portal, conference poster/presentation). Post-docs will be required to pursue, at least, one peer-reviewed publication;
- Participation in entry and exit surveys conducted by the SEEKcommons team.

SEEKCommons Fellows will benefit from these offerings:
- Stipends: $8,000 graduate students, $12,000 post-docs and professionals
- Mentorship from SEEKCommons project and network members
- Training in OS, STS, and Socio-environmental research topics

- Participation in virtual meetings and annual SEEKCommons convenings
- Access to computing infrastructure (via SEEKCommons Lab)
